Gryphon data

Description

     Loading these data loads three objects describing a mythical
     'Gryphon' population used by Wilson et al. to illustrate
     mixed-effect modelling in quantitative genetics. These objects are
     a data frame ‘Gryphon_df’ containing the model variables, a
     genetic relatedness matrix ‘Gryphon_A’, and another data frame
     ‘Gryphon_pedigree’ containing pedigree information (which can be
     used by some packages to reconstruct the relatedness matrix).

Usage

     data("Gryphon")

Format

     ‘Gryphon_df’ is

     'data.frame':   1084 obs. of  6 variables:
      $ ID    : int  1029 1299 ...:               individual identifier
      $ sex   : Factor w/ 2 levels "1","2":       sex, indeed
      $ year  : Factor w/ 34 levels "968","970", ...: birth year
      $ mother: Factor w/ 429 levels "1","2",..:  individual's mother identifier
      $ BWT   : num  10.77 9.3  ...:              birth weight
      $ TARSUS: num  24.8 22.5 12 ...:            tarsus length

     ‘Gryphon_A’ is a genetic relatedness matrix, in sparse matrix
     format, for 1309 individuals.

     ‘Gryphon_pedigree’ is

     'data.frame':   1309 obs. of  3 variables:
      $ ID  : int  1306 1304 ...: individual identifier
      $ Dam : int  NA NA ...:     individual's mother
      $ Sire: int  NA NA ...:     individual's father

     #### Bivariate-response model used as example in Wilson et al. (2010):
     # joint modelling of birth weight (BWT) and tarsus length (TARSUS).

     # The relatedness matrix is specified as a 'corrMatrix'. The random
     # effect 'corrMatrix(0+mv(1,2)|ID)' then represents genetic effects
     # correlated over traits and individuals (see help("composite-ranef")).
     # The ...(0+...) syntax avoids contrasts being used in the design
     # matrix of the random effects, as it would not does make much sense
     # to represent TARSUS as a contrast to BWT.

     # The relatedness matrix will be specified through its inverse,
     # using as_precision(), so that spaMM does not have to find out and
     # inform the user that using the inverse is better (as is typically
     # the case for relatedness matrices). But using as_precision() is
     # not required. See help("algebra") for Details.

     # The second random effect '(0+mv(1,2)|ID)' represents correlated
     # environmental effects. Since measurements are not repeated within
     # individuals, this effect also absorbs all residual variation. The
     # residual variances 'phi' must then be fixed to some negligible values
     # in order to avoid non-identifiability.
